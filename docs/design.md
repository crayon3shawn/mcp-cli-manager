# Design

## Purpose
- CLI tool for managing long-running processes
- Target users: developers who need to manage multiple server processes
- Use cases: development environment, testing environment

## Core Features
1. Process Management
   - Start/stop/restart processes
   - Monitor process status
   - Handle process groups

2. Configuration
   - XDG compliant paths
   - YAML based configuration
   - Environment variable support

3. Error Handling
   - Clear error messages
   - Proper exit codes
   - Logging support

## Limitations
- Not designed for production deployment
- No remote process management
- No GUI interface

## Command Structure
```zsh
mcp <command> [options]

Commands:
  init                    Initialize configuration files
  list                    List all configured servers
  get <server>            Display server configuration details
  start <server>          Start server
  stop <server>           Stop server
  restart <server>        Restart server
  status <server>         Check server status
```

## Technical Details
- Written in zsh (Z shell)
- Modular design with separated concerns
- File-based configuration using YAML
- Environment variable integration

## Security Considerations
- No root privilege requirements
- Process isolation
- Safe configuration handling
- Command injection prevention
- Path traversal detection
