# Design

## Purpose
- CLI tool for managing long-running processes
- Target users: developers who need to manage multiple server processes
- Use cases: development environment, testing environment

## Core Features
1. Process Management
   - Start/stop/restart processes
   - Monitor process status
   - Handle process groups

2. Configuration
   - XDG compliant paths
   - YAML based configuration
   - Environment variable support

3. Error Handling
   - Clear error messages
   - Proper exit codes
   - Logging support

## Limitations
- Not designed for production deployment
- No remote process management
- No GUI interface

## Command Structure
```
mcp <command> [options]

Commands:
  start   <name>     Start a process
  stop    <name>     Stop a process
  restart <name>     Restart a process
  status  [name]     Show process status
  list              List all processes
```

## Security Considerations
- No root privilege requirements
- Process isolation
- Safe configuration handling
